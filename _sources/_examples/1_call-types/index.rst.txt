1. Call Types
=============

Using Python within a Graphical User Interface (GUI) differs significantly from its typical usage in a console application,
requiring special considerations.

The following examples are not specific to PyMpc classes, functions, or methods,
but rather serve to illustrate various approaches to working with Python in the STKO interface.
Familiarity with GUI programming fundamentals can help unlock the full potential of the Python interface in STKO,
enabling you to write effective scripts both as a user and as a developer creating scripts for others.
This section provides a series of examples on call types, which are different methods for invoking processes from the GUI.

#############
1.1. Standard
#############

The first example demonstrates a standard call type with no additional setup.
To simulate a time-consuming operation, the ``sleep`` function is used.
Running this script will cause the GUI to freeze for 0.5 seconds when the ``sleep`` function is called.
In contrast, running this script from a console application would not freeze the visualization,
as the thread running the program is not responsible for generating a graphical interface.
Instead, it would execute sequentially, as expected.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from time import sleep

    print(__file__)
    print(os.getcwd())

    print("start")
    counter = 0
    for i in range(10):
        sleep(0.5)
        counter += 1
        print('iteration {}'.format(counter))
    print("end")

Unlike console applications, GUIs do not run scripts from start to finish on a single thread.
Instead, they create an infinite loop called the event loop, which processes user interactions and updates the graphical interface.
When a standard call type is executed, it shares the same thread as the event loop.
As a result, if a function takes more than a second to complete, the STKO application will become unresponsive, appearing to freeze.
However, this does not indicate a crash; the application is simply busy executing the script and unable to update the GUI.

To effectively perform finite element analysis using **Tcl** or **Python**,
it is essential to understand the available commands in each scripting language,
as well as any new commands specific to the STKO interface.
Note that the **Tcl** and **Python** languages have distinct command sets,
which must be taken into account when scripting.

################
1.2. Process events
################

To prevent the GUI from freezing while running scripts, several approaches can be taken.
One of the simplest solutions is to utilize the processEvents method from the App sub-module.
This function enables the thread to divide its attention between the script and the GUI, allowing for more responsive interaction.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from time import sleep
    from PyMpc import App

    print(__file__)
    print(os.getcwd())

    print("start")
    counter = 0
    for i in range(10):
        sleep(0.5)
        counter += 1
        print('iteration {}'.format(counter))
        App.processEvents()
    print("end")

################
1.3. Working thread
################

Another way to call your process and avoid that the GUI will freeze while it is running, is using a working thread. Here, it is necessary to use the `PySide2 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/>`_ library, which is used to build the STKO GUI. The `PySide2 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/>`_ library is already installed on the Python embedded in STKO, if you are using another Python, reference this link for the installation of `PySide2 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/>`_. You will need to be familiar with the concepts of polymorphism in Python, child and parent classes and inheritance, to understand the following script. The same lengthy function used in the previous two examples is used here, but it is not called directly. First you need to create a Worker class, and use a mechanism available in `PySide2 <https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/>`_ called signal and slot delivery, which is used for communication between objects. A signal is emitted when a particular event occur and a function (the slot) is called in response to that particular signal. Check out more on signal and slot mechanisms in the `Qt Documentation <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/overviews/signalsandslots.html>`_  or through your own research. Therefore, the following script includes a worker class, a signal which will notify the main thread when our process is finished. Inside this class, a function called run is tagged as a slot with the symbol @, which will run the same lengthy function we used before on a parallel working thread.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from time import sleep
    from PySide2.QtCore import Qt, QObject, Signal, Slot, QThread, QEventLoop

    class Worker(QObject):
        finished = Signal()         #signals
        @Slot()                     #lengthy function
        def run(self):              #paste your function here, inside run...

            print(__file__)
            print(os.getcwd())

            counter = 0
            for i in range(10):
                sleep(0.5)
                counter += 1
                print('iteration {}'.format(counter))

            self.finished.emit()    # Done

After defining this class, you can create an event loop that will block the script till the end. Then the thread, the worker, and move the worker to a parallel thread. Then you need to connect the signal to some slots, defining connections, telling the worker to stop the process, to delete itself as soon as it’s over. Further, set up a signal to start calling the run function on the parallel thread. If you were to call the run function directly in your script, without using the QThread class methods, it will run on the GUI thread and not on a parallel one. Same for the worker, you say to the thread to delete when finished and to quit. Then you start the thread, you wait for it to finish and finally run the event loop. Prints can be added to check what is happening in the terminal.

.. code-block:: python

    loop = QEventLoop()

    thread = QThread()
    worker = Worker()
    worker.moveToThread(thread)

    worker.finished.connect(thread.quit)
    worker.finished.connect(worker.deleteLater)
    thread.started.connect(worker.run)
    thread.finished.connect(thread.deleteLater)
    thread.finished.connect(loop.quit)

    print('Starting thread...')
    thread.start()
    print('   Thread started')

    loop.exec_()
    print('DONE!')

Using the function exec_() from the QEventLoop ensures that you have waited for the thread to finish. It is suggested to always use the event loop, to avoid crashing or other errors in STKO. If you run the example script just provided, you can see that interacting with STKO GUI is possible, as our lengthy function is running. What may happen is that the user decides to change the model, as the process is running, altering the data possibly needed by the script. This could result in the crushing of the application. Crushing could also occur if the same script is rerun before the first process is completed.

###################################################
1.4. Working thread with GUI-operation and callback
###################################################

All the operations that is related to the GUI can only be performing on the GUI thread, because that thread is the one that is listening to the operating system events. If you try to perform a GUI operation on a parallel working thread, your STKO will most probably crash. One of the most common GUI operation is the opening of a message box, communicating a message to the user and waiting for an input to continue. It is therefore a possible mistake to run a GUI operation on a parallel thread. See for example what happens if you run the following script in your STKO, where a GUI operation is added in the run function from the previous example.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from time import sleep
    from PySide2.QtCore import Qt, QObject, Signal, Slot, QThread, QEventLoop
    from PySide2.QtWidgets import QMessageBox

    class Worker(QObject):

        finished = Signal()

        @Slot()
        def run(self):
            QMessageBox.information(None, "Title", "Message: Hi there!")

            print(__file__)
            print(os.getcwd())

            counter = 0
            for i in range(10):
                sleep(0.5)
                counter += 1
                print('iteration {}'.format(counter))

            self.finished.emit()

    loop = QEventLoop()

    thread = QThread()
    worker = Worker()
    worker.moveToThread(thread)

    worker.finished.connect(thread.quit)
    worker.finished.connect(worker.deleteLater)
    thread.started.connect(worker.run)
    thread.finished.connect(thread.deleteLater)
    thread.finished.connect(loop.quit)

    print('Starting thread...')
    thread.start()
    print('   Thread started')

    loop.exec_()
    print('DONE!')

It is possible to include in the worker class, a method to run specific functions on the main thread. You can see in the following script, where an additional class called QBlockingSlot, derived from QObject, is created to requests the call for a function, and connect it to the one running of the parallel thread. Whenever the call request is invoked, it will run on the thread that is hosting the class in which the call was created.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from time import sleep
    from PySide2.QtCore import Qt, QObject, Signal, Slot, QThread, QEventLoop
    from PySide2.QtWidgets import QMessageBox, QApplication

    class QBlockingSlot(QObject):
    requestCall = Signal()
    done = Signal()
    def __init__(self, function, parent = None):
    super(QBlockingSlot, self).__init__(parent)
    self.requestCall.connect(self.run)
    self.function = function
    def run(self):
    self.function()
    self.done.emit()
    def call(self):
    loop = QEventLoop()
    self.done.connect(loop.quit)
    self.requestCall.emit()
    loop.exec_()

    def runOnMainThread(what):
    bslot = QBlockingSlot(what)
    bslot.moveToThread(QApplication.instance().thread())
    bslot.call()

    class Worker(QObject):

    finished = Signal()

    @Slot()
    def run(self):
    print(QThread.currentThread())
    def what_to_run():
    print(QThread.currentThread())
    print(QApplication.instance().thread())
    QMessageBox.information(None, 'Title', 'Hi There!')
    runOnMainThread(lambda : what_to_run())

    print(__file__)
    print(os.getcwd())

    counter = 0
    for i in range(10):
    sleep(0.5)
    counter += 1
    print('iteration {}'.format(counter))

    self.finished.emit()

    loop = QEventLoop()

    thread = QThread()
    worker = Worker()
    worker.moveToThread(thread)

    worker.finished.connect(thread.quit)
    worker.finished.connect(worker.deleteLater)
    thread.started.connect(worker.run)
    thread.finished.connect(thread.deleteLater)
    thread.finished.connect(loop.quit)

    print('Starting thread...')
    thread.start()
    print('   Thread started')

    loop.exec_()
    print('DONE!')

The prints set up in the script will show you that the first call is different from the others, and both the main and parallel working thread are involved in the operations.

##################
1.5. Blocking thread
##################

The blocking and working thread use the same concept, the only difference is that here you will have a dialog, which will prevent the user from interacting with the GUI, and notify him/her that a process is running and there will not be the doubt that the software is not responding anymore. You can see in the following script, which has the addition of the WorkerDialog function, derived for the PySide2 QDialog class. The dialog should not close when the user presses the button, or the Escape key, otherwise the thread would stop.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from time import sleep
    from PySide2.QtCore import Qt, QObject, Signal, Slot, QThread, QEventLoop, QTimer
    from PySide2.QtWidgets import QMessageBox, QApplication, QDialog, QLabel, QProgressBar, QVBoxLayout

    class QBlockingSlot(QObject):
        requestCall = Signal()
        done = Signal()
        def __init__(self, function, parent = None):
            super(QBlockingSlot, self).__init__(parent)
            self.requestCall.connect(self.run)
            self.function = function
        def run(self):
            self.function()
            self.done.emit()
        def call(self):
            loop = QEventLoop()
            self.done.connect(loop.quit)
            self.requestCall.emit()
            loop.exec_()

    def runOnMainThread(what):
        bslot = QBlockingSlot(what)
        bslot.moveToThread(QApplication.instance().thread())
        bslot.call()

    class WorkerDialog(QDialog):
        def __init__(self, parent = None):

            super(WorkerDialog, self).__init__(parent)

            self.setWindowFlags(Qt.Window | Qt.WindowTitleHint | Qt.CustomizeWindowHint)
            self.setAttribute(Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose)
            self.setLayout(QVBoxLayout())
            self.layout().addWidget(QLabel("Work in progres. Please wait"))
            self.pbar = QProgressBar()
            self.pbar.setRange(1, 100)
            self.pbar.setTextVisible(True)
            self.layout().addWidget(self.pbar)

            self.setWindowOpacity(0.0)
            self.delay = 0.0
            self.timer = QTimer(self)
            self.timer.setInterval(25)
            self.timer.timeout.connect(self.onTimerTimeOut)
        def showEvent(self, event):

            print('showEvent')
            super(WorkerDialog, self).showEvent(event)
            self.timer.start()

    def reject(self):
        pass
    @Slot(int)
    def setPercentage(self, value):
        self.pbar.setValue(value)
    @Slot()
    def onTimerTimeOut(self):
        if self.delay < 1.0:
            self.delay += 0.05
        else:
            self.setWindowOpacity(self.windowOpacity() + 0.05)
            if self.windowOpacity() == 1.0:
                self.timer.stop()
                self.timer.timeout.disconnect(self.onTimerTimeOut)

    class Worker(QObject):
        sendPercentage = Signal(int)
        finished = Signal()

        @Slot()
        def run(self):
            print(QThread.currentThread())
            def what_to_run():
                print(QThread.currentThread())
                print(QApplication.instance().thread())
                QMessageBox.information(None, 'Title', 'Hi There!')
            runOnMainThread(lambda : what_to_run())

            print(__file__)
            print(os.getcwd())

            counter = 0
            for i in range(10):
                sleep(0.5)
                counter += 1
                print('iteration {}'.format(counter))
                self.sendPercentage.emit(int(float(i+1)/10.0*100.0))

            self.finished.emit()

The rest of the script is the same as the one shown in the working thread example, just instead of an event loop here we have a dialog, and there is new connection established in between the worker and the dialog to send the percentage of process completion, to understand how long it is taking to complete the operation.

.. code-block:: python

    dialog = WorkerDialog()

    thread = QThread()
    worker = Worker()
    worker.moveToThread(thread)

    worker.finished.connect(thread.quit)
    worker.finished.connect(worker.deleteLater)
    thread.started.connect(worker.run)
    thread.finished.connect(thread.deleteLater)
    worker.sendPercentage.connect(dialog.setPercentage)
    thread.finished.connect(dialog.accept)

    print('Starting thread...')
    thread.start()
    print('   Thread started')

    dialog.exec_()
    print('DONE!')

With this script the GUI is blocked, visibly, and you can not interact with it as your process is running. This is the best and most reliable way to interact with STKO from the Python API.

####################
1.6. ThreadUtils
####################

Every time you need to run a new script you do not need to add all of this code to your programs. We created a specific file for you called TreadUtils.py that you can reference in your scripts, calling the following classes and functions and use the same concepts we just explained in a simple and direct manner.

The classes and functions in ThreadUtils are shown below for clarity. The file starts importing everything you need:

.. code-block:: python

    from PySide2.QtCore import Qt, QObject, Signal, Slot, QThread, QEventLoop, QTimer
    from PySide2.QtWidgets import QMessageBox, QApplication, QDialog, QLabel, QProgressBar, QVBoxLayout

You can find the following:

* A simple QObject that wraps a user-defined function, and calls this function waiting for it to finish.

.. code-block:: python

    class QBlockingSlot(QObject):
        requestCall = Signal()
        done = Signal()
        def __init__(self, function, parent = None):
            super(QBlockingSlot, self).__init__(parent)
            self.requestCall.connect(self.run)
            self.function = function
        def run(self):
            self.function()
            self.done.emit()
        def call(self):
            loop = QEventLoop()
            self.done.connect(loop.quit)
            self.requestCall.emit()
            loop.exec_()

* A utility to run a function with a QBlockingSlot on the GUI thread.

.. code-block:: python

    def runOnMainThread(what):
        bslot = QBlockingSlot(what)
        bslot.moveToThread(QApplication.instance().thread())
        bslot.call()

* A simple worker dialog, with a progress bar to track the percentage of an operation.

.. code-block:: python

    class WorkerDialog(QDialog):
        def __init__(self, parent = None):

            super(WorkerDialog, self).__init__(parent)

            self.setWindowFlags(Qt.Window | Qt.WindowTitleHint | Qt.CustomizeWindowHint)
            self.setAttribute(Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose)
            self.setLayout(QVBoxLayout())
            self.layout().addWidget(QLabel("Work in progres. Please wait"))
            self.pbar = QProgressBar()
            self.pbar.setRange(1, 100)
            self.pbar.setTextVisible(True)
            self.layout().addWidget(self.pbar)

            self.setWindowOpacity(0.0)
            self.delay = 0.0
            self.timer = QTimer(self)
            self.timer.setInterval(25)
            self.timer.timeout.connect(self.onTimerTimeOut)
        def showEvent(self, event):

            print('showEvent')
            super(WorkerDialog, self).showEvent(event)
            self.timer.start()

    def reject(self):
        pass
    @Slot(int)
    def setPercentage(self, value):
        self.pbar.setValue(value)
    @Slot()
    def onTimerTimeOut(self):
        if self.delay < 1.0:
            self.delay += 0.05
        else:
            self.setWindowOpacity(self.windowOpacity() + 0.05)
            if self.windowOpacity() == 1.0:
                self.timer.stop()
                self.timer.timeout.disconnect(self.onTimerTimeOut)

* A function which runs the worker (an instance of a class derived from Worker) on a working thread using the provided dialog. The dialog should have the sendPercentage(int) signal defined and should derive from QDialog

.. code-block:: python

    def runOnWorkerThread(worker, dialog = WorkerDialog()):
    # initial checks
    if not isinstance(worker, QObject):
        raise Exception('the worker object should inherit from QObject')
    if not hasattr(worker, 'finished'):
        raise Exception('the worker object should have the finished() signal')
    if not hasattr(worker, 'sendPercentage'):
        raise Exception('the worker object should have the sendPercentage(int) signal')
    if not isinstance(dialog, QDialog):
        raise Exception('the dialog object should inherit from QDialog')
    if not hasattr(dialog, 'setPercentage'):
        raise Exception('the dialog object should have a method called setPercentage(int)')
    if not callable(dialog.setPercentage):
        raise Exception('the dialog object setPercentage attribute is not a callable')

    # create a dialog or an event loop that will block the script till the end
    dialog = WorkerDialog()

    # create the thread, the worker, and move the worker to the thread
    thread = QThread()
    worker.moveToThread(thread)

    # set up worker and thread connections
    worker.finished.connect(thread.quit)
    worker.finished.connect(worker.deleteLater)
    thread.started.connect(worker.run)
    thread.finished.connect(thread.deleteLater)
    worker.sendPercentage.connect(dialog.setPercentage)
    thread.finished.connect(dialog.accept)

    # start the thread
    thread.start()

    # run dialog event loop
    dialog.exec_()

Importing ThreadUtils in your script, after placing it in a folder named “utils” in the directory loaded in your Script Explored, you can use the blocking thread with a much lighter script as following.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from time import sleep
    import importlib
    import utils.ThreadUtils
    importlib.reload(utils.ThreadUtils)
    import utils.ThreadUtils as tu
    from PySide2.QtCore import Qt, QObject, Signal, Slot, QThread
    from PySide2.QtWidgets import QMessageBox, QApplication

    class Worker(QObject):
        sendPercentage = Signal(int)
        finished = Signal()

        @Slot()
        def run(self):
            print(QThread.currentThread())
            def what_to_run():
                print(QThread.currentThread())
                print(QApplication.instance().thread())
                QMessageBox.information(None, 'Title', 'Hi There!')
            tu.runOnMainThread(lambda : what_to_run())

            print(__file__)
            print(os.getcwd())

            counter = 0
            for i in range(10):
                sleep(0.5)
                counter += 1
                print('iteration {}'.format(counter))
                self.sendPercentage.emit(int(float(i+1)/10.0*100.0))

            self.finished.emit()

    tu.runOnWorkerThread(Worker())

Additionally if you want to add an exception to your function before you emit the signal to the thread that the process is finished you can use the sub-module `IO <../../_api/_modules/PyMpc.IO.html>`_, referenced in section Input/Output, substituting the last line of codes in your run function with the following.

.. code-block:: python

    except Exception as ex:
        IO.write_cerr(str(ex))
    finally:
        self.finished.emit() # Done
