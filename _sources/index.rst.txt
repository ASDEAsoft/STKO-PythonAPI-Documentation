STKO Python API Documentation
=============================

STKO, the **Scientific ToolKit for** `OpenSees <https://opensees.berkeley.edu>`_,
is a cutting-edge **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** designed for structural engineering applications.
By harnessing the full power of OpenSees, STKO empowers companies, researchers, academics,
and individuals to unlock the software's vast capabilities.
As the only pre and postprocessor that offers complete integration with OpenSees,
STKO provides unparalleled access to all materials, elements, conditions, and interactions available in OpenSees.

With STKO, you can create complex models using an intuitive graphic interface,
which automatically generates input (Tool Command Language, TCL) and output files containing your model's data.
Once your model is built, you can design and execute custom analyses, leveraging STKO's robust capabilities.
The software then creates an HDF5-based output database, which can be easily opened and processed in the postprocessor.

What's more, STKO's Python scripting interface allows you to customize and extend the pre and postprocessors to meet your specific needs.
This flexibility makes STKO an indispensable tool for anyone working with OpenSees, from beginners to experienced users.
